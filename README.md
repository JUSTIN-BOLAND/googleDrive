# googleDrive
Assorted Google Script projects ranging from custom formatting to databasing for a website.

gettingStarted.gs would be a good place to start if you're not at all familiar with Google Scripts. It lists out most of the built-in methods. The other files are specific applications that you can use to begin building your own projects.

### Drive Guide
I also made a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P43LcvWX83ocMXDHrDogJJKkLFb7DB6IRUSnc6iCmiw/edit?usp=sharing) that covers:
- Docs 
- Sheets
- Slides
- Drawings
- general Drive tips
